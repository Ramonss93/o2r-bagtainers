## Directory listings

The file `dirtree.pl` is a little Perl script by Arjen Bax (via [texblog](http://texblog.org/2012/08/07/semi-automatic-directory-tree-in-latex/#comment-5396) to create directory listings for the LaTeX package [dirtree](http://tug.ctan.org/macros/generic/dirtree/).

```
perl dirtree.pl path/to/directory
```
