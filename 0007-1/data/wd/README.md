### Time-Weighted Dynamic Time Warping for satellite image time series analyses

The opening of large archives of satellite data such as LANDSAT, MODIS and the SENTINELs has given researchers unprecedented access to data, allowing them to better quantify and understand local and global land change. The need to analyse such large data sets has lead to the development of automated and semi-automated methods for satellite image time series analysis. However, few of the proposed methods for remote sensing time series analysis are available as open source software. The package provides an implementation of the Time-Weighted Dynamic Time Warping (TWDTW) method for land use and land cover mapping using sequence of multi-band satellite images (Maus et al. 2016). Methods based on dynamic time warping are flexible to handle irregular sampling and out-of-phase time series, and they have achieved significant results in time series analysis (Velichko and Zagoruyko 1970; Hiroaki Sakoe and Chiba 1971; H. Sakoe and Chiba 1978; Rabiner and Juang 1993; Berndt and Clifford 1994; Keogh and Ratanamahatana 2005; Müller 2007). is available from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) and contributes to making methods for satellite time series analysis available to a larger audience. The package supports the full cycle of land cover classification using image time series, ranging from selecting temporal patterns to visualising and evaluating the results. Bellow we show a quick demo of the package and some [vignettes](#vignettes).

### Install

``` r
devtools::install_github("vwmaus/dtwSat")
```

### Even quicker demo

In this quick dome we will perform a TWDTW analysis for a single time series. The data for the analysis are a set of temporal patterns in `patterns.list` and an example of time series in `example_ts`. These time series are in `zoo` format and come with the package installation. Suppose that we want to know the crop type of each subinterval in following time series:

``` r
library(dtwSat)
# Create and plot object time series
ts = twdtwTimeSeries(example_ts)
class(ts)
plot(ts, type="timeseries")
```

<img src="figure/plot-example_ts-ts-1.png" alt="Figure 1. example_ts time series."  />
<p class="caption">
Figuge 1. example\_ts time series.
</p>

We know that in the region where the time series was observed we have *soybean*, *cotton*, and *maize*, whose typical temporal pattern are:

``` r
# Create and plot object time series
patt = twdtwTimeSeries(patterns.list)
class(patt)
plot(patt, type="patterns")
```

<img src="figure/plot-patterns-1.png" alt="Fig. 2. Typical temporal patterns of *soybean*, *cotton*, and *maize*."  />
<p class="caption">
Fig. 2. Typical temporal patterns of *soybean*, *cotton*, and *maize*.
</p>

Using the these temporal patterns we run the TWDTW analysis, such that

``` r
log_fun = logisticWeight(alpha=-0.1, beta=100) # Logistic time-weight
matches = twdtwApply(x=ts, y=patt, weight.fun=log_fun, keep=TRUE)
```

The result is a `twdtwMatches` object with all possible matches of the patterns to the time series

``` r
class(matches)
show(matches)
```

We can use several plot methods to visualize the results of the analysis in the `twdtwMatches` object, for example, to plot the alignments

``` r
plot(x = matches, type = "alignments")
```

<img src="figure/plot-alignment-1.png" alt="Fig. 3. TWDTW alignments over time and cost (distance) in y-axis."  />
<p class="caption">

</p>

to plot matching point

``` r
plot(x = matches, type = "matches", attr = "evi", patterns.labels="Soybean", k=4)
```

<img src="figure/plot-match-1.png" alt="Fig. 4. The best match for each crop type."  />
<p class="caption">

</p>

to plot minimum cost paths

``` r
plot(x = matches, type = "paths", k = 1:4)
```

<img src="figure/plot-path-1.png" alt="Fig. 5. The minimum cost path of the TWDTW alignment for each crop type."  />
<p class="caption">

</p>

and, finally to classify the subintervals of the time series

``` r
plot(x = matches, type = "classification",
     from = "2009-09-01", to = "2013-09-01",
     by = "6 month", overlap = 0.5)
```

### Raster time series classification

Load raster time series:

``` r
evi = brick(system.file("lucc_MT/data/evi.tif", package="dtwSat"))
ndvi = brick(system.file("lucc_MT/data/ndvi.tif", package="dtwSat"))
red = brick(system.file("lucc_MT/data/red.tif", package="dtwSat"))
blue = brick(system.file("lucc_MT/data/blue.tif", package="dtwSat"))
nir = brick(system.file("lucc_MT/data/nir.tif", package="dtwSat"))
mir = brick(system.file("lucc_MT/data/mir.tif", package="dtwSat"))
doy = brick(system.file("lucc_MT/data/doy.tif", package="dtwSat"))
timeline = scan(system.file("lucc_MT/data/timeline", package="dtwSat"), what="date")
```

Build multi-band raster time series:

``` r
rts = twdtwRaster(evi, ndvi, red, blue, nir, mir, timeline = timeline, doy = doy)
```

Load temporal patterns:

``` r
load(system.file("lucc_MT/temporal_patterns.RData", package="dtwSat"))
patt = twdtwTimeSeries(temporal_patterns)
```

``` r
# Create and plot object time series
load(system.file("lucc_MT/temporal_patterns.RData", package="dtwSat"))
patt = twdtwTimeSeries(temporal_patterns)
plot(patt, type="patterns")
```

<img src="figure/plot-patterns-map-1.png" alt="Fig. 7. Typical temporal patterns of *Cotton-fallow*, *Forest*, *Soybean-cotton*, *Soybean-maize*, and *Soybean-millet*."  />
<p class="caption">

</p>

Apply TWDTW analysis:

``` r
log_fun = weight.fun=logisticWeight(-0.1,50)
r_twdtw = twdtwApply(x=rts, y=patt, weight.fun=log_fun, format="GTiff", overwrite=TRUE)
```

Visualising the results:

Land use maps:

``` r
plot(x = r_lucc, type = "maps")
```

<img src="figure/plot-maps-1.png" alt="Fig. 8. Land use maps based on TWDTW analysis."  />
<p class="caption">

</p>

Land use area:

``` r
plot(x = r_lucc, type = "area")
```

<img src="figure/plot-area-1.png" alt="Fig. 9. Land use area based on TWDTW analysis."  />
<p class="caption">

</p>

Land use changes:

``` r
plot(x = r_lucc, type = "changes")
```

<img src="figure/plot-changes-1.png" alt="Fig. 10. Land use changes based on TWDTW analysis."  />
